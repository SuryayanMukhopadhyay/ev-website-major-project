          we offer a comprehensive refund policy to address your concerns. This
          policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds on products
          purchased through our website.

          <li>
            The item must be returned within 30 days of the delivery date.

            Contact our customer support team at info@rhyno.in or +91-9023987528
            to request a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.

            Clearly write the RMA number on the outside of your return package.

          <li>
            Ship the item to the address provided by our customer support team.
            Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the

            defective product).

        <ul>
          <h2>Refund Approval and Processing</h2>
          <li>
            If approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will
            automatically be applied to your original method of payment within
            7-10 business days.
          </li>
          <li>
            If rejected, we will provide a detailed explanation and discuss
            alternative solutions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h2>Exchanges</h2>
          <li>
            We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need
            to exchange an item for the same product, contact our customer
            support team at info@rhyno.in or +91-9023987528 for assistance.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <li>Check your bank account again.</li>
          <li>
            Contact your credit card company; it may take some time before your
            refund is officially posted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a
            refund is posted.
          </li>
          <li>
            If youâ€™ve done all of this and still have not received your refund,
